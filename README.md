# Portable Exploitation Toolkit

## Description

The Portable Exploitation Toolkit is a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for ethical hacking and penetration testing. It integrates various functionalities, such as SQL injection exploitation, remote command execution, Metasploit automation, vulnerability scanning, reverse shell payload generation, network scanning, brute force attacks, and more.

## Features

1. **Exploit Web Application (SQL Injection)**
2. **Execute Command Remotely via SSH**
3. **Automate Metasploit Exploits**
4. **Scan Vulnerabilities using OWASP ZAP**
5. **Generate Reverse Shell Payloads**
6. **Perform nmap Scans**
7. **Hydra Brute Force Attacks**
8. **Launch Burp Suite and Intercept Traffic**
9. **Automated Report Generation**

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `colorama` library
- Metasploit Framework
- nmap
- Hydra
- OWASP ZAP
- Burp Suite
- `zap-cli`
- `msfvenom`

Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests colorama
```

Ensure all external tools (Metasploit, nmap, Hydra, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) are installed and configured correctly on your system.

## Usage

### Running the Toolkit

Run the toolkit using the following command:

```bash
python3 petoolkit.py
```

### Main Menu Options

1. **Exploit Web Application (SQL Injection)**
    - Enter the target URL.
    - Example: `http://example.com`

2. **Execute Command Remotely**
    - Enter the target IP address.
    - Enter the command to execute.
    - Example: `192.168.1.10`, `ls -la`

3. **Metasploit Exploit**
    - Enter the target IP address.
    - Enter the Metasploit exploit module.
    - Enter the payload to use.
    - Example: `192.168.1.10`, `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`, `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

4. **Scan with OWASP ZAP**
    - Enter the target URL.
    - Example: `http://example.com`

5. **Generate Reverse Shell Payload**
    - Enter your local IP address (LHOST).
    - Enter the local port (LPORT) for reverse shell.
    - Example: `192.168.1.5`, `4444`

6. **Perform nmap Scan**
    - Enter the target IP address.
    - Example: `192.168.1.10`

7. **Perform Hydra Brute Force Attack**
    - Enter the target IP address.
    - Enter the service (e.g., ssh, ftp).
    - Enter the file containing usernames.
    - Enter the file containing passwords.
    - Example: `192.168.1.10`, `ssh`, `usernames.txt`, `passwords.txt`

8. **Launch Burp Suite and Intercept Traffic**
    - Launches Burp Suite and sets up for traffic interception.

9. **Automated Report Generation**
    - Generates an automated report (simulation).

10. **Exit**
    - Exit the toolkit.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the toolkit to perform a SQL injection attack on a web application:

1. Run the toolkit:

    ```bash
    python3 petoolkit.py
    ```

2. Select option 1 from the main menu:

    ```
    1. Exploit Web Application (SQL Injection)
    ```

3. Enter the target URL:

    ```
    Enter the target URL: http://example.com
    ```

The toolkit will attempt a SQL injection attack and display the results.
